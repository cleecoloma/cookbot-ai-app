# Cook Bot APP
[Deployed Link]()
## CookBot is a full-stack application utilizing OpenAI's API in order to build users recipe cards that they can save to their profiles based on their input. Ideally, the user will provide a list of ingredients of items they already have, and the OpenAI will query the request and return an object that the user can view based on the parameters set in the display modal.

**Added Features and Refactored Code**
1. Demo Account - I added demo account to user doesn't have to input personal information to view the functionality of the web application.
2. Recipe Image - AI generated images from OpenAI API only lasts for TWO hours. Instead of displaying no image after two hours, I added a feature to check the time stamp of the AI generated image. If two hours have elapsed from creation, web application will display a default image (spoon and fork image).
3. Styling - I updated the styling web application to be more responsive:
  * Added an extra modal for user to login either via demo code or Auth0.
  * When the recipe button is clicked, recipe is now displayed in a bigger modal.
  * Adjusted carousel to adjust to smaller screens.
